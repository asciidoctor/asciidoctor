module Asciidoctor
# Extensions provide a way to participate in the parsing and converting
# phases of the AsciiDoc processor or extend the AsciiDoc syntax.
#
# The various extensions participate in AsciiDoc processing as follows:
#
# 1. After the source lines are normalized, {Preprocessor}s modify or replace
#    the source lines before parsing begins.  {IncludeProcessor}s are used to
#    process include directives for targets which they claim to handle.
# 2. The Parser parses the block-level content into an abstract syntax tree.
#    Custom blocks and block macros are processed by associated {BlockProcessor}s
#    and {BlockMacroProcessor}s, respectively.
# 3. {Treeprocessor}s are run on the abstract syntax tree.
# 4. Conversion of the document begins, at which point inline markup is processed
#    and converted. Custom inline macros are processed by associated {InlineMacroProcessor}s.
# 5. {Postprocessor}s modify or replace the converted document.
# 6. The output is written to the output stream.
#
# Extensions may be registered globally using the {Extensions.register} method
# or added to a custom {Registry} instance and passed as an option to a single
# Asciidoctor processor.
module Extensions

  # Public: An abstract base class for document and syntax processors.

  # This class provides access to a class-level Hash for holding default
  # configuration options defined using the {Processor.option} method. This

  # and is only consulted inside the initializer. An overriding configuration
  # Hash can be passed to the initializer. Once the processor is initialized,
  # the configuration is accessed using the {Processor#config} instance variable.

  # AST nodes, such as Block and Inline, and for parsing child content.
