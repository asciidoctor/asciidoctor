You can include a glossary in an article, book, and book part by setting the `glossary` style on a section.

== Glossary section syntax

The glossary section is defined as a level 1 section (`==`) when:

* the doctype is `article`
* the doctype is `book` and the book doesn't contain any parts
* the glossary is for a book part

If the book has parts, and the glossary is for the whole book, the section is defined as a level 0 section (`=`).
