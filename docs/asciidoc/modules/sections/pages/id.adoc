[#auto-id]
== Autogenerated IDs

// tag::autoid[]
If you don't specify a custom ID for a section, Asciidoctor automatically generates an ID from the section's title and assigns it to the section.

The ID is derived from the section title as follows:

* Inline formatting is applied.
* All characters are converted to lowercase.
* The value of the `idprefix` attribute (`+_+` by default) is prepended.
* Character references and invalid ID characters are replaced with the value of the `idseparator` attribute (`+_+` by default).
 ** Refer to the {url-ntname}[NT Name^] section of the XML specification for a list of valid ID characters.
* Repeating separator characters are consolidated.
* If necessary, a sequence number is appended until the ID is unique within the document.

For example, the section title `Wiley & Sons, Inc.` produces the ID `_wiley_sons_inc`.
You can customize the replacement characters or toggle ID autogeneration using document attributes.

[#prefix]
=== Change the ID prefix

You can change the ID prefix by setting the `idprefix` attribute.
The value of the `idprefix` attribute must begin with a valid ID start character, must continue with only valid ID characters, and can have any length.

[source]
----
:idprefix: id_
----

If you want to remove the prefix, set the attribute to an empty value.

[source]
----
:idprefix:
----

//WARNING: If you remove the `idprefix`, you could end up with an ID that matches a reserved ID, such as `header`.
//If this happens, adding a custom ID is recommended.

[#separator]
=== Change the ID word separator

You can change the word separator using the `idseparator` attribute.
Unless empty, the value of the `idseparator` must be _exactly one valid ID character_.

[source]
----
:idseparator: -
----

If you don't want to use a separator, set the attribute to an empty value.

[source]
----
:idseparator:
----

NOTE: When a document is rendered on GitHub, the `idprefix` is set to an empty value and the `idseparator` is set to `-`.
These settings are used to ensure that the IDs generated by GitHub match the IDs generated by Asciidoctor.

=== Disable ID generation

To disable the autogeneration of section IDs, unset the `sectids` attribute.

[source]
----
:sectids!:
----

Custom IDs, covered next, are used even when section IDs are disabled.

WARNING: If you disable autogenerated section IDs, and you don't assign a custom ID to a section, you won't be able to create xrefs that link to that section.
// end::autoid[]

== Assign custom IDs

// tag::custom-id[]
You can assign a custom ID and reference text (i.e., label) to a section (see xref:attributes:id.adoc#anchor[anchor]).
The custom ID is used in place of the autogenerated ID.
This can be useful when you want to define a stable anchor for linking to a section using a cross reference.
It also centralizes the reference text used to refer to that section.

Here's an example of a section with a custom ID and reference text:

[source]
----
include::{examplesdir}/section.adoc[tag=with-anchor]
----

The ID can be written using the following shorthand (though there's no shorthand yet for the reference text):

[source]
----
include::{examplesdir}/section.adoc[tag=with-anchor-shorthand]
----

IMPORTANT: Asciidoctor permits all valid UTF-8 characters in section IDs.
If you're generating a PDF from AsciiDoc using a2x and dblatex, see {url-adoc-a2x}[Using UTF-8 titles with a2x^] to learn about the required `latex.encoding=utf8` switch.
// end::custom-id[]

[#link]
== Turn section titles into links

// tag::link[]
To turn section titles into links, enable the `sectlinks` attribute.
The default Asciidoctor stylesheet displays linked section titles with the same color and styles as unlinked section titles.
// end::link[]

[#anchor]
== Add &sect; to section titles

// tag::anchor[]
When the `sectanchors` attribute is enabled on a document, an anchor (empty link) is added before the section title.
The default Asciidoctor stylesheet renders the anchor as a section entity (*&sect;*) that floats to the left of the section title.
// end::anchor[]
