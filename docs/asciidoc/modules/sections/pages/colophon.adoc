Book colophons list information such as the ISBN, publishing house, edition and copyright dates, legal notices and disclaimers, cover art, book layout credits, and any significant production notes.
The colophon, sometimes referred to as a copyright page, is displayed on the verso side of the title page; however, it can also be located in the book's back matter.

== Colophon syntax

To use the `colophon` section style, the document type must be `book`.
The section must be a level 1 section (`==`), unless the book has parts.
