== Book chapters (Asciidoctor PDF only)

When using Asciidoctor PDF and the document type is `book`, level 1 section titles (`==`) are automatically prefixed with _Chapter_, then the autogenerated chapter number, followed by the title.
For example:

 Chapter 1: Title

[#chapter-label]
=== Chapter labels

You can modify the chapter label by defining the `chapter-label` attribute.

[source]
----
:chapter-label: Peat√ºkk
----

The `chapter-label` value should be followed by a space to separate the autogenerated number from the label.
To remove the label, unset the attribute (`:chapter-label!:`).

== Book parts

Parts can only be used when the document type is `book`.
There is no dedicated `doctype` for a multi-part book to distinguish it from a regular book.
That distinction is made by the section levels you use.

Parts are specified by a level 0 section (`=`).
Each part must contain at least one section (a chapter or special section).

=== Special sections for parts

A part can have its own preface, bibliography, glossary and index.

[#part-label]
=== Part labels

The part label is automatically added to the beginning of the part title.
You can modify the label by defining the `part-label` attribute.

:part-label: Component

The `part-label` value should be followed by a space to separate the autogenerated number from the label.

=== Part introduction

You can insert optional introduction content beneath the part section before the first chapter.
