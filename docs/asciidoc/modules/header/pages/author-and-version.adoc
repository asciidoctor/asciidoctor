== Author syntax

The author of a document is listed on the line beneath the document's title.
An optional email address or URL can follow an author's name inside angle brackets.

Let's add an author with her email address to the document below.

As you can see in the example above, Asciidoctor uses the author's name and email to assign values to a number of built-in attributes that can be used throughout the document's body.
These attributes include:

`author`::
The author's full name, which includes all of the characters or words prior to a semicolon (`;`), angle bracket (`<`) or the end of the line.

`firstname`::
The first word in the author attribute.

`lastname`::
The last word in the author attribute.

`middlename`::
If a firstname and lastname are present, any remaining words or characters found between these attributes are assigned to the middlename attribute.

`authorinitials`::
The first character of the firstname, middlename, and lastname attributes.

`email`::
An email address, delimited by angle brackets (`< >`).

If one or more of the author's names consists of more than one word, use an underscore (`+_+`) between the words you want to adjoin.
For example, the author of the following document has a compound last name.

.Result: Rendered author information when author has a compound name

Alternatively, the author and email attributes can be set explicitly in the header.

The `html5` and `docbook` converters can convert documents with multiple authors.
Multiple authors and their emails are separated by semicolons (`;`) when they're listed on the same line.

[source]
----
include::{examplesdir}/author.adoc[tag=multi]
----
<1> To reference the additional authors in the document body, the author attributes are appended with an underscore (`+_+`) followed by the position of the author in the author information list (i.e., Lazarus het Draeke is the second author in the list so his author attributes are appended with a 2).

.Result: Rendered author information when document has multiple authors

#Fix ex#
//image::multi-author.png[Multiple author and email attributes]

If you want to enter multiple authors and their emails as attribute entries, the attribute names are as follows:

[source]
----
include::multi-author-email-long.adoc[]
----

.Result
====
image::multi-author-email-long.png[Multiple author and email attributes]

Where does `authored` (empty string '' if {author} or {email} defined) fit in?

=== Attribute references in the author line

The implicit author line was not intended to support arbitrary placement of attribute references.
While attribute references are replaced in the author line (as part of the header substitution group), they aren't substituted until _after_ the line is parsed.
This ordering can sometimes produce undesirable or surprising results.
It's best to use the author line strictly as a shorthand for defining a fixed author and email.

If you do need to use attribute references in the author or email value, you should revert to defining the attributes explicitly using attribute entries.

----
= Document Title
:author_name: ACME Industries
:author_email: info@acme.com
:author: {author_name}
:email: {author_email}
----

Just remember that the author line is for static text.
Once you graduate beyond static text, you should switch to using attribute entries to define the built-in author attributes, which will give you much more power.

== Version, revision and date syntax

The revision information is read from the third (non-attribute) line of the header, beneath the author information line.
A document's revision information has slots for three implicit attributes.

`revnumber`::
The document's version number.
In order to be recognized, the version number must contain at least one numeric character.
Any letters or symbols preceding the numeric character are ignored.
If the implicit `revnumber` is on a line by itself, it must begin with the "`v`" character (e.g., `v7.0.6`) or be followed by a comma (e.g., `2.3,`)
If the implicit `revdate` is present, it must be separated from the `revnumber` by a comma (e.g., `2020-10-10, v78.1`).

`revdate`::
The date the document version was completed.
When the `revnumber` or `revremark` attributes are set, but `revdate` is not, then `revdate` will be assigned the `docdate` value.

`revremark`::
Information about this version of the document.

Here's an example of a revision line.

[source]
----
include::{examplesdir}/revision.adoc[tag=base]
----
<1> revnumber and revdate must be separated by a comma (`,`).
<2> revdate can contain words, letters, numbers, and symbols.
<3> The revremark attribute must be preceded by a colon (`:`), regardless of whether revnumber or revdate are set.

.Result: Rendered revision information displayed on the byline and referenced in the document's body
====
#Fix ex#
//image::rev.png[Revision attributes]
====

The revnumber in the byline is prefixed by the word _Version_; however, when referenced in the body of the document, only the numerical value is displayed.
The `version-label` attribute controls the version number label in the byline.
The revision information attributes can also be explicitly set in the header.

[source]
----
include::{examplesdir}/revision.adoc[tag=attr]
----
<1> When explicitly set, any characters preceding the version number are *not* dropped.
<2> The revremark can contain attribute references.
<3> The version-label attribute is unset so that the word _Version_ does not precede the revnumber in the byline.

.Result: Rendered revision information when revision attributes are explicitly set
====
#Fix ex#
//image::rev-long.png[Explicitly set revision attributes]
====

In the converted document, notice that the _V_ preceding the revnumber is capitalized in the byline but not when the attribute is referenced in the body of the document.

//NOTE: Revision extraction information and an extraction example are pending.
