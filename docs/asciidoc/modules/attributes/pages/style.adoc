= The Style Attribute
// attr-style.adoc, included in user-manual: Attributes: Style

The style attribute is the first positional attribute in an attribute list.
It specifies a predefined set of characteristics to apply to a block element or macro.

For example, a paragraph block can be assigned one of the following built-in style attributes:

* normal (default, so does not need to be set)
* literal
* verse
* quote
* listing
* TIP
* NOTE
* IMPORTANT
* WARNING
* CAUTION
* abstract
* partintro
* comment
* example
* sidebar
* source

// Needs examples!
