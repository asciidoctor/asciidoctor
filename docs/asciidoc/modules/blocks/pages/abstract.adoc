= Abstract Block Style

An abstract is a concise overview of a document.
The `abstract` block style can be placed on an open block or paragraph.
Here's an example of the abstract block style set on a paragraph:

[source]
----
= Document Title

[abstract]
.Abstract
Documentation is a distillation of many long adventures.

== First Section
----

The abstract block style does not require the open block or paragraph to have a title, and it does not depend on a subsequent section to terminate it.

[source]
----
= Document Title

[abstract]

TIP: To include a quote at the beginning of a chapter in a book, wrap a quote block inside an abstract block.

There's also an xref:sections:abstract.adoc[abstract section style].
