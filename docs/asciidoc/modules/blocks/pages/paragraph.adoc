The bulk of the content in a document is paragraph text.
This is why Asciidoctor doesn't require any special markup or attributes to specify paragraph content.
You can just start typing.

== Create a paragraph

In Asciidoctor, adjacent or consecutive lines of text form a paragraph element.
To start a new paragraph after another element, such as a section title or table, hit the kbd:[RETURN] key twice to insert a blank line, and then continue typing your content.

Since adjacent lines of text are combined into a single paragraph when Asciidoctor converts a document, that means you can wrap paragraph text or put each sentence or phrase on a separate line.
The line breaks won't appear in the output.

However, if you want the line breaks in a paragraph to be preserved, you can either use a space followed by a plus sign (`{plus}`) or the `hardbreaks` attribute.
This results in a visible line break (e.g., `<br>`) following each line.

Alternatively, you can preserve line breaks throughout your whole document by adding the `hardbreaks` attribute to the document's header.

You can also preserve line breaks using xref:source:literal.adoc[literal blocks], xref:source:listing.adoc[listing blocks], and xref:verse.adoc[verses].
