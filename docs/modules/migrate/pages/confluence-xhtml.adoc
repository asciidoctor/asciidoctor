You can convert Atlassian Confluence XHTML pages to Asciidoctor using this Groovy script.

The script calls {url-pandoc}[Pandoc^] to convert single or multiple HTML files exported from Confluence to AsciiDoc files.
You'll need Pandoc installed before running this script.
If you have trouble running this script, you can use the Pandoc command referenced inside the script to convert XHTML files to AsciiDoc manually.

== Usage

. Save the script contents to a `convert.groovy` file in a working directory.
. Make the file executable according to your specific OS requirements.
. Create an `html` directory for input files and an `asciidoc` directory for output files, both inside the working directory.
. Place individual files, or a directory containing files, into the aforementioned `html` directory.
. Run `groovy convert` to convert the files contained inside the `html` directory.
. Look for the generated output file in the `asciidoc` directory and confirm it meets your requirements.
