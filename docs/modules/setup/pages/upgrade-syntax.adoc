|pass:[= Title]
|
|Allowed with `compat-mode`

|Two-line style document title

pass:[=====]
|pass:[= Title]
|
|Asciidoctor accepts the two-line heading style to set the document title.
However, by using it, you implicitly set `compat-mode`.
If you want to use the new Asciidoctor syntax, make sure to use `= Title` or explicitly unset the `compat-mode` attribute.

=== Compatibility mode

When it isn't feasibly to update your documents prior to upgrading Asciidoctor, you can run Asciidoctor in compatibility mode.
Compatibility mode is activated by setting the `compat-mode` attribute and allows Asciidoctor to accept and apply the deprecated syntax and/or behavior.
However, *not all deprecated syntax or behavior is available under the compatibility mode*.

//We highly recommend that you update your documents and extensions to use the new syntax.
