= Manage Images

Images are not embedded in the HTML output by default.
If you have image references in your document, you'll have to save the image files in the same directory as your converted document.

== Embed images with the data-uri attribute

As an alternative, you can embed the images directly into the document by setting the `data-uri` document attribute.

.data-uri attribute set in document header
[source,asciidoc]
----
include::example$my-document.adoc[tag=title]
:imagesdir: my-images
:data-uri:
include::example$my-document.adoc[tags=body;image]
----

You can also set `data-uri` using the API or CLI (shown here):

 $ asciidoctor -a data-uri my-document.adoc

When you view the HTML file in your browser, you should see the image displayed in the page.

image::my-document-with-data-uri.png[]

== allow-uri-read attribute

If the target of one or more images in the document is a URI, you must also set the `allow-uri-read` attribute securely and run Asciidoctor in `SECURE` mode or less.

 $ asciidoctor -a data-uri -a allow-uri-read my-document.adoc

The same is true when converting the document to PDF using Asciidoctor PDF, even if the `allow-uri-read` attribute is not set (since the behavior is implied).
