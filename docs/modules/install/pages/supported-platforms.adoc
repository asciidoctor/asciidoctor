= Supported Platforms and System Requirements
:navtitle: Supported Platforms
:ge: &#8805;

Asciidoctor operates on Linux, macOS, and Windows and requires one of the supported Ruby implementations listed in the next section.

Our general policy is to align Asciidoctor's support of a platform version with the upstream project's lifecycle schedule for that version.
When a platform version reaches the end of active support by its maintainers or its end of life--which ever comes first--Asciidoctor no longer supports it.

== Ruby runtimes

Asciidoctor requires one of the following implementations of {url-ruby}[Ruby^].

[%autowidth]
|===
|Supported Runtime |Supported Versions

|Ruby
|{ge} 2.7

|JRuby
|{ge} 9.2

|TruffleRuby
|{ge} 22.2
|===

== Operating systems

[%autowidth]
|===
|Supported OS |Supported Versions

|Ubuntu
|{ge} 18.04 LTS

|Fedora
|{ge} 36

|macOS
|{ge} macOS 11 (Big Sur)

|Microsoft
|{ge} Windows 10 +
Windows Server 2019
|===

While the community tests Asciidoctor on a variety of Linux distributions, it's only officially tested on Ubuntu and Fedora.

== System encoding

Asciidoctor assumes you're using UTF-8 encoding.
To minimize encoding problems, make sure the default encoding of your system is set to UTF-8.

If you're using a non-English Windows environment, you may bump into an `Encoding::UndefinedConversionError` when invoking Asciidoctor.
To solve this issue, we recommend overriding the default external and internal character encodings to `utf-8`.
You can do so by setting the `RUBYOPT` environment variable as follows:

 RUBYOPT="-E utf-8:utf-8"

Once you make this change, all your Unicode headaches should be behind you.

If you're using an IDE like Eclipse, make sure you set the encoding to UTF-8 there as well.
Asciidoctor is optimized to work with UTF-8 as the default encoding.
