= Supported Platforms and System Requirements
:navtitle: Supported Platforms

Asciidoctor operates on Linux, macOS, and Windows and requires one of the supported Ruby implementations listed in the next section.

Our general policy is to align Asciidoctor's support of a platform version with the upstream project's lifecycle schedule for that version.
When a platform version reaches the end of active support by its maintainers or its end of life--which ever comes first--Asciidoctor no longer supports it.
