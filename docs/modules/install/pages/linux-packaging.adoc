The benefit of using your operating system's package manager to install the gem is that it handles installing Ruby and the RubyGems library if those packages are not already installed on your machine.

== Package versions

The version of Asciidoctor installed by the package manager may not match the latest release of Asciidoctor.
Consult the package repository for your distribution to find out which version is packaged per distribution release.
