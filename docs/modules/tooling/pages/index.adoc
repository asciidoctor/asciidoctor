Since AsciiDoc syntax is just plain text, you can write an AsciiDoc document using any text editor.
You don't need complex word processing programs like Microsoft Word or Google Docs.
In fact, you shouldn't use these programs because they add cruft to your document that you can't see that makes conversion tedious.

Here's an overview of the different ways to preview and edit your AsciiDoc documents.

== Hosted git repositories

Many popular git repository hosts, including https://github.com/[GitHub], https://about.gitlab.com/[GitLab], and https://codeberg.org/[Codeberg], support editing and previewing AsciiDoc files.
In order to activate this support, the file must have a supported AsciiDoc extension, such as `.adoc`.

When you view an AsciiDoc file on these sites, you will see an HTML preview of the AsciiDoc content.
This preview is powered by Asciidoctor.
The HTML that's rendered is the embedded output produced by the built-in HTML converter.
This means it won't look like a standalone HTML document generated by Asciidoctor.
Rather, the HTML is styled to match the theme of the hosting service and sanitized, so it does not impact the rendering of the page.
This means that certain features may not be available.

GitHub and GitLab apply syntax highlighting to source blocks.
Both services also add floating anchor links next to section titles.
You can deep link to a specific section or to another anchor by adding a fragment identifier to the URL.

The AsciiDoc preview on GitLab currently supports more AsciiDoc features than on GitHub.
On GitLab, you can find support for include directives, admonition icons, diagrams, and STEM expressions.
GitHub, on the other hand, provides a table of contents browser, whereas on GitLab you must add a TOC explicitly using the `toc` attribute.

On GitHub, if you want to see the source of an AsciiDoc file instead of the preview, click the btn:[Code] button or append `?plain=1` to the end of the URL.
Alternatively, if you enter edit mode by clicking the btn:[Edit file] button, you can modify the source of the AsciiDoc file and see a preview of the modified source before you commit your changes.

== Web browser add-ons (preview only)

To preview an AsciiDoc document in a web browser, install the {url-chrome-extension}[Chrome extension^], the {url-edge-addon}[Edge add-on^], the {url-firefox-addon}[Firefox add-on^], or the {url-opera-extension}[Opera extension^] (all produced from the same code base).
Then you can see the AsciiDoc file rendered as HTML just by visiting it.

== IDEs and text editors

The following IDEs and text editors support the AsciiDoc syntax and most provide document preview rendering with Asciidoctor.

=== AsciiDocFX

{url-asciidocfx}[AsciiDoc FX^] is an editor and terminal emulator written with JavaFX 8.

To enable the AsciiDoc lexer, follow these steps:
