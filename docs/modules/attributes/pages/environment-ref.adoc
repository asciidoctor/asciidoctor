Asciidoctor automatically assigns values to various document attributes whenever a document is loaded or converted.
These attributes, termed [.term]_environment attributes_, provide information about the runtime environment, such as how, where and when the document is being processed.
Like other document attributes, environment attributes can be referenced where ever attribute references are permitted.
It's recommended that you treat these attributes as read only.

[[note_docdatetime]]^[1]^ Only reflects the last modified time of the source document file.
It does not consider the last modified time of files which are included.

[[note_sourcedateepoch]]^[2]^ If the SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH environment variable is set, the value assigned to this attribute is built from a UTC date object that corresponds to the timestamp (as an integer) stored in that environment variable.
This override offers one way to make the conversion reproducible.
See the {url-epoch}[source date epoch specification] for more information about the SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH environment variable.
