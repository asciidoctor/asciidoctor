Book colophons list information such as the ISBN, publishing house, edition and copyright dates, legal notices and disclaimers, cover art, design, and book layout credits, and any significant production notes.
In most mass market books, the colophon is on the verso (back side) of the title page, but it can also be located at the end of the book.
