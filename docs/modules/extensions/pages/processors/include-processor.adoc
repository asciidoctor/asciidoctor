= Include Processor (Document)

IncludeProcessor is a DocumentProcessor

The `include::` preprocessor instruction has a target and attributes.
The registered IncludeProcessors are queried by calling their `handles?` method with the target to determine if the processor wishes to handle the include instruction.
The first processor to return true is the only processor used.
Not implementing a `handles?` method indicates that the processor wishes to handle all includes.

== Registration method

An IncludeProcessor is registered with `include_processor`.

== Superclass

Asciidoctor::Extensions::IncludeProcessor

== DSL methods

include::page$processor.adoc[tag=docproc]

`handles? *args &block`::
No args may be supplied.
The block should have a `target` parameter to receive the `include::` instruction target.

== Process method

`def process document, reader, target, attributes`

The process method is called from a PreprocessorReader.
The document has not yet been parsed although (some) document attributes may be available.

The process method should put the additional content to be included into an array of lines and call `reader.push_include lines` to add the content.
Any return value is ignored.

== Example

Purpose::
Include a file from a URI.

TIP: Asciidoctor supports including content from a URI out of the box if you set the `allow-uri-read` attribute (not available if the safe mode is `secure`).
