= Errors and Warnings

////
um anchor: appendix#app-messages

Only includes the CLI. asciidoctorj and the asciidoctor API are not included.
When there are enough documented, maybe add another table for them. Although these users are programmers-wouldn't they just run it in the debugger?

Testing was carried out with
Asciidoctor 1.5.5 [https://asciidoctor.org]
Runtime Environment (ruby 2.3.1p112 (2016-04-26) [i386-linux-gnu]) (lc:UTF-8 fs:UTF-8 in:- ex:UTF-8)
////

All warning, error, and failure messages emitted by the Asciidoctor CLI are written to the console via stderr (i.e., standard error).
Most messages also apply to the API, but they're written directly to stderr.

== Notification types

<<warning,WARNING>>::
Warnings do not stop conversion, but they indicate possible problems, and the output may not be what you were expecting.

<<error,ERROR>>::
Errors do not stop conversion, but the output document will almost certainly be wrong.

<<fail,FAILED>>::
Failures are fatal; no output document will be produced.

The messages listed in the following sections may contain some of the following representative placeholders:

<docname>::
Represents the basename of the source file being processed (e.g., `sample.adoc`).

<file>::
Represents a path to the input file or other referenced file.

<uri>::
Represents a URI being referenced.

<x> or <y>::
Placeholders for other contextual information in the message.

|<id> is a duplicate ID, meaning it has already been assigned to a node of <type> (e.g., section, block, anchor).
If you don't see the problem in <docname>, check that the duplicate ID isn't coming from a file which is being included.

// But [#wibble,id="wobble"] does not generate an error
