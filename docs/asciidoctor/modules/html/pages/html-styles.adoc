= Style the HTML with CSS

Asciidoctor uses CSS for HTML document styling and JavaScript for generating document attributes such as a table of contents and footnotes.
It comes bundled with a stylesheet, named [.path]_asciidoctor.css_.
When you generate a document with the `html5` backend, the [.path]_asciidoctor.css_ stylesheet is embedded into the HTML output by default (when the safe mode is less than `SECURE`).

You have the option of linking to the stylesheet instead of embedding it.
This is the mandatory behavior when the safe mode is SECURE.
If your stylesheet is being linked when you expect it to be embedded, lower the safe mode (`safe` is the recommend value).

To have your document link to the stylesheet, set the `linkcss` attribute in the document's header.

You can also set linkcss with the CLI.

 $ asciidoctor -a linkcss mysample.adoc

Now, when you view the directory, you should see the file [.path]_asciidoctor.css_ in addition to [.path]_mysample.adoc_ and [.path]_mysample.html_.
The linkcss attribute automatically copies [.path]_asciidoctor.css_ to the output directory.
Additionally, you can inspect [.path]_mysample.html_ in your browser and see `<link rel="stylesheet" href="./asciidoctor.css">` inside the `<head>` tags.

If you don't want any styles applied to the HTML output of your document, unset the `stylesheet` attribute.

 $ asciidoctor -a stylesheet! mysample.adoc

One of Asciidoctor's strengths is the ease in which you can swap the default stylesheet for your own xref:create-theme.adoc[custom stylesheet].
