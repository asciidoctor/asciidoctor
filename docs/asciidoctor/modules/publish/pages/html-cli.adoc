== HTML

Asciidoctor's default output format is HTML.

`html5`:: HTML 5 markup styled with CSS3.

In this section, we'll create a sample document, then process and convert it with Asciidoctor's `html5` converter.

. Create an AsciiDoc file like the one below
. Save the file as [.path]_mysample.adoc_

[source]
----
include::{examplesdir}/mysample.adoc[]
----

To convert [.path]_mysample.adoc_ to HTML from the command line:

. Open a console
. Switch to the directory that contains the [.path]_mysample.adoc_ document
. Call the Asciidoctor processor with the `asciidoctor` command, followed by the name of the document you want to convert

//^

 $ asciidoctor mysample.adoc

Remember, Asciidoctor's default converter is html5, so it isn't necessary to specify it with the `-b` command.

You won't see any messages printed to the console.
If you type `ls` or view the directory in a file manager, there is a new file named [.path]_mysample.html_.

 $ ls
 mysample.adoc  mysample.html

Asciidoctor derives the name of the output document from the name of the input document.

Open [.path]_mysample.html_ in your web browser.
Your document should look like the image below.

====
#fix ex#
//image::mysample.png[]
====

The document's text, titles, and link is styled by the default Asciidoctor stylesheet, which is embedded in the HTML output.
As a result, you could save [.path]_mysample.html_ to any computer and it will look the same.
