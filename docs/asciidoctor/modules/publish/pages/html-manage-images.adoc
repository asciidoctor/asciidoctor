= Manage Images
// html-manage-images.adoc, included in convert-documents and user-manual

Images are not embedded in the HTML output by default.
If you have image references in your document, you'll have to save the image files in the same directory as your converted document.

As an alternative, you can embed the images directly into the document by setting the `data-uri` document attribute.

 $ asciidoctor -a data-uri mysample.adoc

[source]
----
include::{examplesdir}/mysample-data-uri.adoc[]
----

====
#fix ex#
//image::mysample-data-uri.png[]
====

If the target of one or more images in the document is a URI, you must also set the `allow-uri-read` attribute securely and run Asciidoctor in `SECURE` mode or less.

 $ asciidoctor -a data-uri -a allow-uri-read mysample.adoc

The same is true when converting the document to PDF using Asciidoctor PDF, even if the `allow-uri-read` attribute is not set (since the behavior is implied).
