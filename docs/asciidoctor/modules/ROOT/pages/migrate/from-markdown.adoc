= Migrate from Markdown

Asciidoctor recognizes a fair amount of Markdown syntax, thus allowing you to migrate from Markdown to AsciiDoc gradually.
See #asciidoc-syntax-quick-reference/markdown-compatibility,Markdown Compatibility# to learn what syntax is shared.
The syntax you must change is listed in #asciidoc-vs-markdown#.
