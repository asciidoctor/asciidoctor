= Migrate to Asciidoctor

In this part, you'll learn how to migrate documents written in other markup languages to AsciiDoc.
We'll start with the simplest migration, switching from AsciiDoc Python, the original implementation of AsciiDoc, to Asciidoctor, the modern implementation.
We'll then cover how to move to AsciiDoc from other languages and processors like DocBook, Markdown and HTML.
In addition to differences in the syntax, many of the sections also suggest tools you can use to ease the migration.
