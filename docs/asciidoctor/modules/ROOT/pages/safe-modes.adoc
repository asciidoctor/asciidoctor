= Run Securely with Safe Modes
// secure.adoc, included in user-manual: Running Asciidoctor Securely

Asciidoctor provides security levels that control the read and write access of attributes, the include directive, macros, and scripts while a document is processing.
Each level includes the restrictions enabled in the prior security level.

== Safe modes

`UNSAFE`::
A safe mode level that disables any security features enforced by Asciidoctor.
Ruby is still subject to its own restrictions.
+
*This is the default safe mode for the CLI.*
Its integer value is `0`.

`SAFE`::
This safe mode level prevents access to files which reside outside of the parent directory of the source file.
The `include` directive is enabled, but paths to `include` files must be within the parent directory.
This mode allows assets (such as the stylesheet) to be embedded in the document.
+
Its integer value is `1`.

`SERVER`::
A safe mode level that disallows the document from setting attributes that would affect conversion of the document.
This level trims `docfile` to its relative path and prevents the document from:
+
--
* setting `source-highlighter`, `doctype`, `docinfo` and `backend`
* seeing `docdir`

It allows `icons` and `linkcss`.

Its integer value is `10`.
--

`SECURE`::
A safe mode level that disallows the document from attempting to read files from the file system and including their contents into the document.
Additionally, it:
+
--
* disables icons
* disables the `include` directive
* data can not be retrieved from URIs
* prevents access to stylesheets and JavaScripts
* sets the backend to `html5`
* disables `docinfo` files
* disables `data-uri`
* disables `docdir` and `docfile`
* disables source highlighting

xref:extensions::index.adoc[Asciidoctor extensions] may still embed content into the document depending whether they honor the safe mode setting.

*This is the default safe mode for the API.*
Its integer value is `20`.

You can set the xref:cli:set-safe-mode.adoc[safe mode from the CLI] and the xref:api:set-safe-mode.adoc[API].
Asciidoctor also provides access to the current safe mode through xref:asciidoc:directives:safe-modes.adoc[built-in attributes].
You can use these attributes to enable or disable content based on the current safe mode of the processor.
