When the Asciidoctor gem is installed successfully, the Asciidoctor command line interface (CLI) will be available on your PATH.
To confirm that Asciidoctor is available, execute:

 $ asciidoctor --version

The following information should be output in your terminal:

 Asciidoctor 1.5.8 [https://asciidoctor.org]

To invoke Asciidoctor from the CLI and convert an `.adoc` file, execute:

 $ asciidoctor <asciidoc_file>

This will use the built-in defaults for options and create a new file in the same directory as the input file, with the same base name, but with the `.html` extension.

The xref:cli-options-and-parameters.adoc[Command Line Options and Parameters] describes the available Asciidoctor CLI options and parameters.

Full help is provided in the {url-manpage}[Asciidoctor man page^] or via:

 $ asciidoctor --help

//There is also an `asciidoctor-safe` command, which turns on safe mode by default, preventing access to files outside the parent directory of the source file.
