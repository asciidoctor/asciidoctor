= Choose a Converter

Asciidoctor provides several built-in converters and the ability to add on other converters.
In addition to generating traditional articles and books from AsciiDoc documents, you can also use Asciidoctor to create HTML-based slide decks, static websites, and documentation sites.
When using these web publishing converters, you may need to add some additional structure rules to a document.
However, nothing in this structure restricts you from still being able to publish the content as a normal document too.

Converter:: Generates a specific output format from AsciiDoc.
Each converter is mapped to a name that you specify using the `-b` (`--backend`) command line option or `backend` API option.

== Built-in converters

These built-in converters are bundled with Asciidoctor.

HTML 5::
The HTML 5 converter (`html` or `html5`) generates HTML 5 styled with CSS3.
This is the converter Asciidoctor uses by default.

XHTML 5::
The XHTML variant (`xhtml` or `xhtml5`) of the HTML 5 converter.

DocBook 5.0::
The DocBook 5.0 converter (`docbook` or `docbook5`) generates DocBook 5.0 XML.

xref:manpage:convert-to-man-page.adoc[Man page]::
The man page converter (`manpage`) generates manual pages for software used on Unix and Unix-like operating systems.

== Document and book converters

You can use add-on converters, which plug into Asciidoctor by adding the appropriate library to the runtime path (e.g., `-r asciidoctor-pdf`).

== PDFs

Conversion from AsciiDoc to PDF is made possible by a number of tools.

{uri-asciidoctor-pdf}[Asciidoctor PDF]::
A native PDF converter for Asciidoctor (converts directly from AsciiDoc to PDF using Prawn).
+
Instructions for installing and using Asciidoctor PDF are documented in the project's {uri-asciidoctor-pdf-readme}[README].
The tool provides built-in theming via a YAML configuration file, which is documented in the {uri-asciidoctor-pdf-theming-guide}[theming guide].
+
TIP: Asciidoctor PDF is the preferred tool for converting to PDF and is fully supported by the Asciidoctor community.

a2x::
A DocBook toolchain frontend provided by that AsciiDoc Python project.
+
To use this tool, you should first convert to DocBook using Asciidoctor, then convert the DocBook to PDF using a2x.
a2x accepts a DocBook file as input and can convert it to a PDF using either Apache FOP or dblatex.
Instructions for using a2x are documented in the project's {uri-a2x-manpage}[man page].

{fopub-ref}[asciidoctor-fopub]::
A DocBook toolchain frontend similar to a2x, but which only requires Java to be installed on your machine.
+
Instructions for using asciidoctor-fopub are documented in the project's {fopub-doc-ref}[README].
To alter the look and feel of the PDF, it's necessary to pass XSL parameters or modify the XSLT.
More information about customization can be found in http://www.sagehill.net/docbookxsl/[DocBook XSL: The Complete Guide].
