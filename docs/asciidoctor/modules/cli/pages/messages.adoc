um anchor: appendix#app-messages

Only includes the CLI. asciidoctorj and the asciidoctor API are not included.
When there are enough documented, maybe add another table for them. Although these users are programmers-wouldn't they just run it in the debugger?

Testing was carried out with
Asciidoctor 1.5.5 [https://asciidoctor.org]
Runtime Environment (ruby 2.3.1p112 (2016-04-26) [i386-linux-gnu]) (lc:UTF-8 fs:UTF-8 in:- ex:UTF-8)
////

All warning, error, and failure messages emitted by the Asciidoctor CLI (i.e., `asciidoctor`) are listed in the table below.
These messages are written to the console via stderr (i.e., standard error).
Most messages also apply to the API, though keep in mind they're written directly to stderr.
