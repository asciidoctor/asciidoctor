== Upgrade on Linux

The Linux packages may not be available immediately after a release of a new Asciidoctor gem.
It may take several weeks for the packages to be updated.
If you need to upgrade to the latest version immediately, use the xref:install.adoc#gem[gem install option].

=== apk

On Alpine Linux, you can update the package using:

 $ sudo apk add --upgrade asciidoctor

=== apt-get

On Debian or Ubuntu, you can update the package using:

 $ sudo apt-get upgrade asciidoctor

=== dnf

TIP: Your Fedora system is probably configured to automatically update packages, in which case no further action is required by you.

On Fedora, you can update the package using:

 $ sudo dnf update asciidoctor

== Upgrade on macOS with Homebrew

include::{partialsdir}/upgrade-on-macos.adoc[]

== Upgrade using gem

You can upgrade Asciidoctor using the gem `upgrade` command:

 $ gem update asciidoctor

[TIP]
====
If you accidentally use `gem install` instead of `gem update`, then you'll end up with both versions installed.
To remove the older version, use the following `gem` command:

 $ gem cleanup asciidoctor
