= Upgrade Syntax, Attributes and Commands
//Syntax, Attributes, and Commands: What's Changed?

IMPORTANT: This page if for users upgrading from a previous version of Asciidoctor to the latest stable version of Asciidoctor.
If your migrating from AsciiDoc Python, see the xref:ROOT:migrate/from-asciidoc-python.adoc[documentation for migrating from AsciiDoc Python to Asciidoctor].

When you upgrade Asciidoctor you may also need to update some of the syntax and attributes in your AsciiDoc documents.
Major version releases can include reworkings of some of the AsciiDoc syntax in an effort to make it more consistent, deterministic and easy to learn.

== Updated and deprecated features

The syntax, attributes, and commands listed below have been updated or deprecated.
In most cases, they've been replaced with a new feature that provides improved functionality.

|===
|Feature |Deprecated |New |As of Version |Notes

|Implicit document title attribute

|pass:[= Title]
|
|Allowed with `compat-mode`

|Two-line style document title
|pass:[= Title] +
pass:[=====]
|pass:[= Title]
|
|Asciidoctor accepts the two-line heading style to set the document title.
However, by using it, you implicitly set `compat-mode`.
If you want to use the new Asciidoctor syntax, make sure to use `= Title` or explicitly unset the `compat-mode` attribute.

== Compatibility mode

When it isn't feasibly to update your documents prior to upgrading Asciidoctor, you can run Asciidoctor in compatibility mode.
Compatibility mode is activated by setting the `compat-mode` attribute and allows Asciidoctor to accept and apply the deprecated syntax and/or behavior.
However, *not all deprecated syntax or behavior is available under the compatibility mode*.
