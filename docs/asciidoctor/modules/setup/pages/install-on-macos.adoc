= Install Asciidoctor on macOS
:release-version: 1.5.8
:url-homebrew: https://brew.sh/
// http://brewformulas.org/Asciidoctor

You can use Homebrew, the macOS package manager, to install Asciidoctor.
If you don't have Homebrew on your computer, complete the installation instructions at {url-homebrew}[brew.sh] first.

Once Homebrew is installed, you're ready to install the `asciidoctor` gem.
Open a terminal and type:

 $ brew install asciidoctor

Homebrew installs the `asciidoctor` gem into an exclusive prefix that's independent of system gems.
