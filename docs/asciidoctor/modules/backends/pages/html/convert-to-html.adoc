= Generate HTML from AsciiDoc

== Convert AsciiDoc to HTML

Asciidoctor's default output format is HTML.

`html5`:: HTML 5 markup styled with CSS3.

In this section, we'll create a sample document, then process and convert it with Asciidoctor's `html5` converter.

. Create an AsciiDoc file like the one below
. Save the file as [.path]_my-sample.adoc_

[source,asciidoc]
----
include::example$mysample.adoc[]
----

To convert [.path]_my-sample.adoc_ to HTML from the command line:

. Open a console
. Switch to the directory that contains the [.path]_my-sample.adoc_ document
. Call the Asciidoctor processor with the `asciidoctor` command, followed by the name of the document you want to convert

//^

 $ asciidoctor my-sample.adoc

Remember, Asciidoctor's default converter is html5, so it isn't necessary to specify it with the `-b` command.

You won't see any messages printed to the console.
If you type `ls` or view the directory in a file manager, there is a new file named [.path]_my-sample.html_.

 $ ls
 my-sample.adoc  my-sample.html

Asciidoctor derives the name of the output document from the name of the input document.

Open [.path]_my-sample.html_ in your web browser.
Your document should look like the image below.

====
#fix ex#
//image::mysample.png[]
====

The document's text, titles, and link is styled by the default Asciidoctor stylesheet, which is embedded in the HTML output.
As a result, you could save [.path]_my-sample.html_ to any computer and it will look the same.

[#xhtml]
== Convert AsciiDoc to XHTML

To convert AsciiDoc to XHTML, set the backend to `xhtml5`.

.Produce XHTML using the built-in HTML converter
[source,console]
----
asciidoctor -b xhtml5 document.adoc
----

To produce XHTML instead of HTML when using converter templates, set the `htmlsyntax` attribute to `xml` in addition to the backend option:

.Produce XHTML using custom templates
[source,console]
----
asciidoctor -T /path/to/templates -b slides -a htmlsyntax=xml document.adoc
----

.Black Box Decoded: XHTML and htmlsyntax
****
XHTML output is a special mode of the built-in HTML5 converter.
It is activated by prefixing the backend value with `x` (e.g., `xhtml` or `xhtml5`).
This hint implicitly assigns the `htmlsyntax` attribute to the value `xml`, which normally has the value `html`.

For all other converters, the `htmlsyntax` attribute is not set explicitly.
If you want a converter template that's written in Slim or Haml to output XHTML instead of the default HTML, you simply need to set the `htmlsyntax` attribute to `xml` explicitly.
Asciidoctor will pass on this preference to the Slim or Haml template engine by setting the `:format` option to `:html5`.
