= Manage Stylesheets

Asciidoctor comes bundled with a stylesheet, named [.path]_asciidoctor.css_.
It uses this stylesheet for HTML document styling and JavaScript for generating document attributes such as a table of contents and footnotes.

== Embed a stylesheet

When you generate a document with the `html5` backend, the [.path]_asciidoctor.css_ stylesheet is embedded into the HTML output by default when the safe mode is less than `SECURE`.
If your stylesheet is being linked to when you expect it to be embedded, lower the safe mode (`safe` is the recommend value).

== Link to a stylesheet

You can link to the stylesheet instead of embedding it.
This is the mandatory behavior when the safe mode is `SECURE`.

To have your document link to the stylesheet, set the `linkcss` attribute in the document's header.

[source,asciidoc]
----
include::example$mysample-link.adoc[]
----

You can also set `linkcss` with the CLI.

 $ asciidoctor -a linkcss my-sample.adoc

Now, when you view the directory, you should see the file [.path]_asciidoctor.css_ in addition to [.path]_my-sample.adoc_ and [.path]_my-sample.html_.
The `linkcss` attribute automatically copies [.path]_asciidoctor.css_ to the output directory.
Additionally, you can inspect [.path]_my-sample.html_ in your browser and see `<link rel="stylesheet" href="./asciidoctor.css">` inside the `<head>` tags.

== Don't apply a stylesheet

If you don't want any styles applied to the HTML output of your document, unset the `stylesheet` attribute.

 $ asciidoctor -a stylesheet! my-sample.adoc

One of Asciidoctor's strengths is the ease in which you can swap the default stylesheet for your own xref:html/apply-stylesheet.adoc[custom stylesheet].
