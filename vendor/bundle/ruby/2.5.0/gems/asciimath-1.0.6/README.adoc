## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

[source,ruby]
----
gem 'asciimath'
----

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install asciimath

## Usage

### Library

First require the library.

[source,ruby]
----
require 'asciimath'
----

Then parse an AsciiMath string.

[source,ruby]
----
parsed_expression = AsciiMath.parse(asciimath)
----

The parsed expression is a set of nested Array and Hash objects.

This expression can then be converted to MathML or HTML (experimental.

[source,ruby]
----
math_ml = parsed_expression.to_mathml
html = parsed_expression.to_html
----

The MathML or HTML code is returned as a String.

### Command line

The AsciiMath parser and converters can be invoked via the command line as follows:

.MathML Generation
[source]
----
asciimath "an asciimath string"

or

asciimath mathml "an asciimath string"
----

.HTML Generation
[source]
----
asciimath html "an asciimath string"
----

This command will print out the generated code on stdout.


## Notes on the HTML Output

The HTML output is still regarded somewhat experimental - for basic usage it is fine, but it is not yet complete.
Known issues are as follows:

 * `sqrt` function does not generate sane output
 * Use of font commands (e.g. `bb`) will result in broken output.
 * Accents do not extend to match what they cover.
 * Rendering of "integrals" uses a generic path that does not look amazing.
 * The size of braces does not account for complex content - so a matrix will render with the right sized braces if all of its elements are single-height text, but braces around e.g. fractions will render at the incorrect height.

Rendering the HTML output correctly requires the inclusion of `style/math.css` in the html document.
There is currently no specific required font for this output, it simply selects a `serif` font family - change the `@font-family` attribute in the `.math-inline` class to select something specific.
