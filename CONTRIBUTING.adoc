== License Agreement

By contributing changes to this repository, you agree to license your contributions under the <<LICENSE#,MIT license>>.
This ensures your contributions have the same license as the project and that the community is free to use your contributions.
You also assert that you are the original author of the work that you are contributing unless otherwise stated.

== Submitting an Issue

We use the {uri-issues}[issue tracker on GitHub] associated with this project to track bugs and features.
Before submitting a bug report or feature request, check to make sure it hasn't already been submitted.
When submitting a bug report, please include a {uri-gist}[Gist] that includes any details that may help reproduce the bug, including your gem version, Ruby version, and operating system.

Most importantly, since Asciidoctor is a text processor, reproducing most bugs requires that we have some snippet of text on which Asciidoctor exhibits the bad behavior.

An ideal bug report would include a pull request with failing specs.

== Submitting a Pull Request

. {uri-fork-help}[Fork the repository].
. Run `NOKOGIRI_USE_SYSTEM_LIBRARIES=1 bundle` to install development dependencies.
  - If the `bundle` command is not available, run `gem install bundler` to install it.

=== Background Knowledge

As Asciidoctor is built using Ruby some basic knowledge of Ruby, RubyGems and Minitest is beneficial. The following resources provide a good starting point for contributors who may not be completely comfortable with these tools:

* https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/quickstart/[Ruby in 20 minutes]
* https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/ruby-from-other-languages/[Ruby from other languages]
* http://guides.rubygems.org/rubygems-basics/[RubyGems basics]
* http://guides.rubygems.org/what-is-a-gem/[What is a Gem?]
* http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/short-introduction-minitest[How to use Minitest]
* http://www.rubyinside.com/a-minitestspec-tutorial-elegant-spec-style-testing-that-comes-with-ruby-5354.html[Minitest spec tutorial]
* https://github.com/seattlerb/minitest/blob/master/README.rdoc[Minitest Project Documentation]

While these resources don't cover everything needed they serve as a good starting off point for beginners.

=== Writing and Executing Tests

Tests live inside the test directory and are named <topic>_test.rb.
For instance, tests for the different types of blocks can be found in the file test/blocks_test.rb.

Within a test file, individual test cases are organized inside of contexts.
A context is type of logical container that groups related tests together.

Each test case follows the same structure:

[source]
----
test 'description of test' do
  # test logic
end
----

At the moment, the tests are quite primitive.
Here's how a typical test operates:

. Defines sample AsciiDoc source
. Renders the document to HTML or DocBook
. Uses XPath and CSS expressions to verify expected output

Here's how we might test the open block syntax:

[source]
----
test 'should render content bounded by two consecutive hyphens as an open block' do
  input = <<-EOS
--
This is an open block.
--
  EOS
  result = render_embedded_string input
  assert_css '.openblock', result, 1
  assert_css '.openblock p', result, 1
  assert_xpath '/div[@class="openblock"]//p[text()="This is an open block."]', result, 1
end
----

As you can see, several helpers are used to facilitate the test scenario.
The `render_embedded_string` invokes Asciidoctor's render method with the header and footer option disabled.
This method is ideal for unit-level tests.
If you need to test the whole document, use `render_string` instead.
The `assert_css` and `assert_xpath` assertion methods take a CSS or XPath selector, respectively, the rendered result and the number of expected matches.
You can also use built-in assertions in Ruby's test library.

To run all the tests, simply execute `rake`:

 $ rake

NOTE: The tests should only take a few seconds to run using Ruby 2.1.

If you want to run a single test file, you can use `ruby`:

 $ ruby test/blocks_test.rb

To test a single test case, first add the string "wip" to the beginning of the description.
For example:

[source]
----
test 'wip should render ...' do
  ...
end
----

Then, run `ruby` again, but this time pass a selector argument so it finds matching tests:

 $ ruby test/blocks_test.rb -n /wip/

You can also turn on verbose mode if you want to see more output:

 $ ruby test/blocks_test.rb -n /wip/ -v

Once you are done with your test, make sure to remove `wip` from the description and run all the tests again using `rake`.

We plan on switching to a more elegant testing framework in the future, such as RSpec or Cucumber, in order to make the tests more clear and robust.

=== Running Asciidoctor in Development Mode

Asciidoctor is designed so that you can run the script directly out of the cloned repository.
Simply execute the `asciidoctor` command directly (referencing it either by relative or absolute path).
There's no need to install it using the `gem` command first.

For example, to convert the README file, switch to the root of the project and run:

 $ ./bin/asciidoctor README.adoc

IMPORTANT: You'll need to make sure you reference the correct relative path to the `asciidoctor` command.

If you want to be able to execute the `asciidoctor` command from any directory without worrying about the relative (or absolute) path, you can setup the following Bash alias:

 alias asciidoctor-dev="/path/to/asciidoctor/bin/asciidoctor"

Now you can execute the `asciidoctor` command from any folder as follows:

 $ asciidoctor-dev README.adoc

== Supporting Additional Ruby Versions

If you would like this library to support another Ruby version, you may volunteer to be a maintainer.
Being a maintainer entails making sure all tests run and pass on that implementation.
When something breaks on your implementation, you will be expected to provide patches in a timely fashion.
If critical issues for a particular implementation exist at the time of a major release, support for that Ruby version may be dropped.
