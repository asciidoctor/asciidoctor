{asciidoctor}[Asciidoctor] is a pure Ruby processor for converting
{asciidoc}[AsciiDoc] source files and strings into HTML 5, DocBook 4.5
and other formats.

Asciidoctor uses a set of built-in ERB templates to render the document
to HTML 5 or DocBook 4.5. We've matched the rendered output as close as
possible to the default output of the native Python processor. You can
override this behavior by providing {tilt}[Tilt]-compatible templates.
See the xref:usage[Usage section] for more details.

Asciidoctor currently works (read as 'tested') with Ruby 1.8.7, Ruby
1.9.3 and JRuby 1.7.2 (on Linux, Mac and Windows). We expect it will
work with other versions of Ruby as well and would welcome help in
testing it out.

The initial code from which Asciidoctor started emerged from the
{gitscm-next}[Git SCM site repo]. Refer to commit history of
{asciidoctor-seed}[asciidoc.rb] to view the initial contributions and
individual contributors.

The source code can now be found in the {asciidoctor-source}[Asciidoctor
source repository] on GitHub.

== Installation

NOTE: We are working hard to make Asciidoctor a drop-in replacement for
AsciiDoc. We're very close, with nearly 600 tests that ensure
compatibility. The march is on towards full compliance and beyond.

To install the gem:

 gem install asciidoctor

Or if you prefer bundler:

 bundle install asciidoctor

== Usage

To use Asciidoctor in your application, you first need to require the
library:

 require 'asciidoctor'

With that in place, you can start processing AsciiDoc documents.

.Loading a document
To parse a file into an `Asciidoctor::Document` object:

 doc = Asciidoctor.load_file('your_file.asciidoc')

You can get information about the document:

 puts doc.doctitle
 puts doc.attributes

More than likely, you want to just render the document.

.Rendering files
To render a file containing AsciiDoc markup to HTML 5:

 Asciidoctor.render_file('your_file.asciidoc', :in_place => true)

The command will output to the file `your_file.html` in the same
directory. You can render the file to DocBook 4.5 by setting the
`backend` attribute to 'docbook':

 Asciidoctor.render_file('your_file.asciidoc', :in_place => true,
   :attributes => {'backend' => 'docbook'})

The command will output to the file `your_file.xml` in the same
directory. (If you're on Linux, you can view the file using yelp).

.Rendering strings
To render an AsciiDoc-formatted string:

 puts Asciidoctor.render('*This* is it.')

When rendering a string, the header and footer are excluded by default
to make Asciidoctor consistent with other lightweight markup engines
like Markdown. If you want the header and footer, just declare it as
an option:

 puts Asciidoctor.render('*This* is it.', :header_footer => true)

Now you'll get a full HTML 5 file. As before, you can also produce
DocBook 4.5:

 puts Asciidoctor.render('*This* is it.', :header_footer => true,
   :attributes => {'backend' => 'docbook'})

If you don't like the output you see, you can change it. Any of it!

.Custom templates
Asciidoctor allows you to override the {templates}[built-in templates]
used to render almost any individual AsciiDoc element. If you provide a
directory of {tilt}[Tilt]-compatible templates, named in such a way that
Asciidoctor can figure out which template goes with which element,
Asciidoctor will use the templates in this directory instead of its
built-in templates for any elements for which it finds a matching
template. It will fallback to its default templates for everything else.

 puts Asciidoctor.render('*This* is it.', :header_footer => true,
   :template_dir => 'templates')

The Document and Section templates should begin with `document.` and
`section.`, respectively. The file extension is used by Tilt to
determine which view framework it will use to use to render the
template. For instance, if you want to write the template in ERB, you'd
name these two templates `document.html.erb` and `section.html.erb`. To
use Haml, you'd name them `document.html.haml` and `section.html.haml`.

Templates for block elements, like a Paragraph or Sidebar, would begin
with `block_<style>.`. For instance, to override the default Paragraph
template with an ERB template, put a file named
`block_paragraph.html.erb` in the template directory you pass to the
`Document` constructor using the `template_dir` option.

.Commandline
If you don't like all this Ruby code just to render AsciiDoc, there's a
commandline interface (cli) named `asciidoctor`. It should be available
on your PATH after installing the gem. The `asciidoctor` command a
drop-in replacement for the `asciidoc` command from the AsciiDoc Python
distribution.

For more usage examples, see the (massive) test suite.

== Contributing

In the spirit of {freesoftware}[free software], 'everyone' is
encouraged to help improve this project.

Here are some ways *you* can contribute:

* by using alpha, beta, and prerelease versions
* by reporting bugs
* by suggesting new features
* by writing or editing documentation
* by writing specifications
* by writing code -- 'No patch is too small.'
** fix typos
** add comments
** clean up inconsistent whitespace
** write tests!
* by refactoring code
* by fixing {issues}[issues]
* by reviewing patches

== Submitting an Issue

We use the {issues}[GitHub issue tracker] associated with this project
to track bugs and features.  Before submitting a bug report or feature
request, check to make sure it hasn't already been submitted. When
submitting a bug report, please include a {gist}[Gist] that includes
any details that may help reproduce the bug, including your gem
version, Ruby version, and operating system.

Most importantly, since Asciidoctor is a text processor, reproducing
most bugs requires that we have some snippet of text on which
Asciidoctor exhibits the bad behavior.

An ideal bug report would include a pull request with failing specs.

== Submitting a Pull Request

. {fork}[Fork the repository].
. {branch}[Create a topic branch].
. Add tests for your unimplemented feature or bug fix.
. Run `bundle exec rake`. If your tests pass, return to step 3.
. Implement your feature or bug fix.
. Run `bundle exec rake`. If your tests fail, return to step 5.
. Add documentation for your feature or bug fix.
. If your changes are not 100% documented, go back to step 7.
. Add, commit, and push your changes.
. {pr}[Submit a pull request].


== Supported Ruby Versions

This library aims to support the following Ruby implementations:

* Ruby 1.8.7
* Ruby 1.9.3
* JRuby 1.7.2

If something doesn't work on one of these interpreters, it should be
considered a bug.

If you would like this library to support another Ruby version, you
may volunteer to be a maintainer. Being a maintainer entails making
sure all tests run and pass on that implementation. When something
breaks on your implementation, you will be personally responsible for
providing patches in a timely fashion. If critical issues for a
particular implementation exist at the time of a major release,
support for that Ruby version may be dropped.
