== NAME

asciidoctor - converts AsciiDoc source files to HTML, DocBook and other formats

== SYNOPSIS

*asciidoctor* [_OPTION_]... _FILE_...

== DESCRIPTION

The asciidoctor(1) command converts the AsciiDoc source file(s) _FILE_ to HTML5, DocBook 5, DocBook 4.5, man(ual) page and other custom output formats.

If _FILE_ is _-_ then the AsciiDoc source is read from standard input.

== OPTIONS

=== Security Settings

*-B, --base-dir*=_DIR_::
  Base directory containing the document and resources.
  Defaults to the directory containing the source file, or the working directory if the source is read from a stream.
  When combined with the safe mode setting, can be used to chroot the execution of the program.

*-S, --safe-mode*=_SAFE_MODE_::
  Set safe mode level: _unsafe_, _safe_, _server_ or _secure_.
  Disables potentially dangerous macros in source files, such as `include::[]`.
  If not set, the safe mode level defaults to _unsafe_ when Asciidoctor is invoked using this script.

*--safe*::
  Set safe mode level to _safe_.
  Enables include directives, but prevents access to ancestor paths of source file.
  Provided for compatibility with the asciidoc command.
  If not set, the safe mode level defaults to _unsafe_ when Asciidoctor is invoked using this script.

=== Document Settings

*-a, --attribute*=_ATTRIBUTE_::
  Define, override or delete a document attribute.
  Command-line attributes take precedence over attributes defined in the source file unless the value ends with _@_.
+
_ATTRIBUTE_ is normally formatted as a key-value pair, in the form _NAME=VALUE_.
Alternate acceptable forms are _NAME_ (where the _VALUE_ defaults to an empty string), _NAME!_ (unassigns the _NAME_ attribute) and _NAME=VALUE@_ (where _VALUE_ does not override value of _NAME_ attribute if it's already defined in the source document).
Values containing spaces should be enclosed in quotes.
+
This option may be specified more than once.

*-b, --backend*=_BACKEND_::
  Backend output file format: _html5_, _docbook5_, _docbook45_ and _manpage_ are supported out of the box.
  You can also use the backend alias names _html_ (aliased to _html5_) or _docbook_ (aliased to _docbook5_).
  Other values can be passed, but if Asciidoctor cannot resolve the backend to a converter, it will fail.
  Defaults to _html5_.

*-d, --doctype*=_DOCTYPE_::
  Document type: _article_, _book_, _manpage_ or _inline_.
  Sets the root element when using the _docbook_ backend and the style class on the HTML body element when using the _html_ backend.
  The _book_ document type allows multiple level-0 section titles in a single document.
  The _manpage_ document type enables parsing of metadata necessary to produce a man page.
  The _inline_ document type allows the content of a single paragraph to be formatted and returned without wrapping it in a containing element.
  Defaults to _article_.

=== Rendering Control

*-C, --compact*::
  Compact the output by removing blank lines.
  (No longer in use).

*-D, --destination-dir*=_DIR_::
  Destination output directory.
  Defaults to the directory containing the source file, or the working directory if the source is read from a stream.
  If specified, the directory is resolved relative to the working directory.

*-E, --template-engine*=_NAME_::
  Template engine to use for the custom converter templates.
  The gem with the same name as the engine will be loaded automatically.
  This name is also used to build the full path to the custom converter templates.
  If a template engine is not specified, it will be auto-detected based on the file extension of the custom converter templates found.

*-e, --eruby*::
  Specifies the eRuby implementation to use for executing the custom converter templates written in ERB.
  Supported values are _erb_ and _erubis_.
  Defaults to _erb_.

*-I, --load-path*=_DIRECTORY_::
  Add the specified directory to the load path, so that _-r_ can load extensions from outside the default Ruby load path.
  This option may be specified more than once.

*-n, --section-numbers*::
  Auto-number section titles.
  Synonym for *--attribute numbered*.

*-o, --out-file*=_OUT_FILE_::
  Write output to file _OUT_FILE_.
  Defaults to the base name of the input file suffixed with _backend_ extension.
  The file is resolved relative to the working directory.
  If the input is read from standard input or a named pipe (fifo), then the output file defaults to stdout.
  If _OUT_FILE_ is _-_, then the output file is written to standard output.

*-R, --source-dir*=_DIR_::
  Source directory.
  Currently only used if the destination directory is also specified.
  Used to preserve the directory structure of files converted within this directory in the destination directory.
  If specified, the directory is resolved relative to the working directory.

*-r, --require*=_LIBRARY_::
  Require the specified library before executing the processor, using the standard Ruby require.
  This option may be specified more than once.

*-s, --no-header-footer*::
  Suppress the document header and footer in the output.

*-T, --template-dir*=_DIR_::
  A directory containing custom converter templates that override one or more templates from the built-in set.
  (requires _tilt_ gem)
+
If there is a subfolder that matches the engine name (if specified), that folder is appended to the template directory path.
Similarly, if there is a subfolder in the resulting template directory that matches the name of the backend, that folder is appended to the template directory path.
+
This option may be specified more than once.
Matching templates found in subsequent directories override ones previously discovered.

=== Processing Information

*-q, --quiet*::
  Silence warnings.

*--trace*::
  Include backtrace information on errors.
  Not enabled by default.

*-v, --verbose*::
  Verbosely print processing information and configuration file checks to stderr.

*-t, --timings*::
  Display timings information (time to read, parse and convert).

=== Program Information

*-h, --help* [_TOPIC_]::
  Print the help message.
  Show the command usage if _TOPIC_ is not specified (or not recognized).
  Dump the Asciidoctor man page (in troff/groff format) if _TOPIC_ is _manpage_.

*-V, --version*::
  Print program version number.
+
`-v` can also be used if no other flags or arguments are present.

== ENVIRONMENT

*Asciidoctor* honors the *SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH* environment variable.
If this variable is assigned an integer value, that value is used as the epoch of all input documents and as the local date and time.
See https://reproducible-builds.org/specs/source-date-epoch/ for more information about this environment variable.

== EXIT STATUS

*0*::
  Success.

*1*::
  Failure (syntax or usage error; configuration error; document processing failure; unexpected error).
