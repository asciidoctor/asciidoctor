.SH "NAME"
asciidoctor \- converts AsciiDoc source files to HTML, DocBook and other formats
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
\fBasciidoctor\fP [\fIOPTION\fP]... \fIFILE\fP...
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
The asciidoctor(1) command converts the AsciiDoc source file(s) \fIFILE\fP to HTML5, DocBook 5, DocBook 4.5, man(ual) page and other custom output formats.
.sp
If \fIFILE\fP is \fI\-\fP then the AsciiDoc source is read from standard input.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.SS "Security Settings"
.sp
\fB\-B, \-\-base\-dir\fP=\fIDIR\fP
.RS 4
Base directory containing the document and resources.
Defaults to the directory containing the source file, or the working directory if the source is read from a stream.
When combined with the safe mode setting, can be used to chroot the execution of the program.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-S, \-\-safe\-mode\fP=\fISAFE_MODE\fP
.RS 4
Set safe mode level: \fIunsafe\fP, \fIsafe\fP, \fIserver\fP or \fIsecure\fP.
Disables potentially dangerous macros in source files, such as \f[CR]include::[]\fP.
If not set, the safe mode level defaults to \fIunsafe\fP when Asciidoctor is invoked using this script.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-safe\fP
.RS 4
Set safe mode level to \fIsafe\fP.
Enables include directives, but prevents access to ancestor paths of source file.
Provided for compatibility with the asciidoc command.
If not set, the safe mode level defaults to \fIunsafe\fP when Asciidoctor is invoked using this script.
.RE
.SS "Document Settings"
.sp
\fB\-a, \-\-attribute\fP=\fIATTRIBUTE\fP
.RS 4
Define, override or delete a document attribute.
Command\-line attributes take precedence over attributes defined in the source file unless the value ends with \fI@\fP.
.sp
\fIATTRIBUTE\fP is normally formatted as a key\-value pair, in the form \fINAME=VALUE\fP.
Alternate acceptable forms are \fINAME\fP (where the \fIVALUE\fP defaults to an empty string), \fINAME!\fP (unassigns the \fINAME\fP attribute) and \fINAME=VALUE@\fP (where \fIVALUE\fP does not override value of \fINAME\fP attribute if it\(cqs already defined in the source document).
Values containing spaces should be enclosed in quotes.
.sp
This option may be specified more than once.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-b, \-\-backend\fP=\fIBACKEND\fP
.RS 4
Backend output file format: \fIhtml5\fP, \fIdocbook5\fP, \fIdocbook45\fP and \fImanpage\fP are supported out of the box.
You can also use the backend alias names \fIhtml\fP (aliased to \fIhtml5\fP) or \fIdocbook\fP (aliased to \fIdocbook5\fP).
Other values can be passed, but if Asciidoctor cannot resolve the backend to a converter, it will fail.
Defaults to \fIhtml5\fP.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-d, \-\-doctype\fP=\fIDOCTYPE\fP
.RS 4
Document type: \fIarticle\fP, \fIbook\fP, \fImanpage\fP or \fIinline\fP.
Sets the root element when using the \fIdocbook\fP backend and the style class on the HTML body element when using the \fIhtml\fP backend.
The \fIbook\fP document type allows multiple level\-0 section titles in a single document.
The \fImanpage\fP document type enables parsing of metadata necessary to produce a man page.
The \fIinline\fP document type allows the content of a single paragraph to be formatted and returned without wrapping it in a containing element.
Defaults to \fIarticle\fP.
.RE
.SS "Rendering Control"
.sp
\fB\-C, \-\-compact\fP
.RS 4
Compact the output by removing blank lines.
(No longer in use).
.RE
.sp
\fB\-D, \-\-destination\-dir\fP=\fIDIR\fP
.RS 4
Destination output directory.
Defaults to the directory containing the source file, or the working directory if the source is read from a stream.
If specified, the directory is resolved relative to the working directory.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-E, \-\-template\-engine\fP=\fINAME\fP
.RS 4
Template engine to use for the custom converter templates.
The gem with the same name as the engine will be loaded automatically.
This name is also used to build the full path to the custom converter templates.
If a template engine is not specified, it will be auto\-detected based on the file extension of the custom converter templates found.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-e, \-\-eruby\fP
.RS 4
Specifies the eRuby implementation to use for executing the custom converter templates written in ERB.
Supported values are \fIerb\fP and \fIerubis\fP.
Defaults to \fIerb\fP.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-I, \-\-load\-path\fP=\fIDIRECTORY\fP
.RS 4
Add the specified directory to the load path, so that \fI\-r\fP can load extensions from outside the default Ruby load path.
This option may be specified more than once.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-n, \-\-section\-numbers\fP
.RS 4
Auto\-number section titles.
Synonym for \fB\-\-attribute numbered\fP.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-o, \-\-out\-file\fP=\fIOUT_FILE\fP
.RS 4
Write output to file \fIOUT_FILE\fP.
Defaults to the base name of the input file suffixed with \fIbackend\fP extension.
The file is resolved relative to the working directory.
If the input is read from standard input or a named pipe (fifo), then the output file defaults to stdout.
If \fIOUT_FILE\fP is \fI\-\fP, then the output file is written to standard output.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-R, \-\-source\-dir\fP=\fIDIR\fP
.RS 4
Source directory.
Currently only used if the destination directory is also specified.
Used to preserve the directory structure of files converted within this directory in the destination directory.
If specified, the directory is resolved relative to the working directory.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-r, \-\-require\fP=\fILIBRARY\fP
.RS 4
Require the specified library before executing the processor, using the standard Ruby require.
This option may be specified more than once.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-s, \-\-no\-header\-footer\fP
.RS 4
Suppress the document header and footer in the output.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-T, \-\-template\-dir\fP=\fIDIR\fP
.RS 4
A directory containing custom converter templates that override one or more templates from the built\-in set.
(requires \fItilt\fP gem)
.sp
If there is a subfolder that matches the engine name (if specified), that folder is appended to the template directory path.
Similarly, if there is a subfolder in the resulting template directory that matches the name of the backend, that folder is appended to the template directory path.
.sp
This option may be specified more than once.
Matching templates found in subsequent directories override ones previously discovered.
.RE
.SS "Processing Information"
.sp
\fB\-q, \-\-quiet\fP
.RS 4

.SS "Program Information"
.sp
\fB\-h, \-\-help\fP [\fITOPIC\fP]
.RS 4
Print the help message.
Show the command usage if \fITOPIC\fP is not specified (or not recognized).

.RE
.sp
\fB\-V, \-\-version\fP
.RS 4
