{homepage}[Asciidoctor] is a pure Ruby processor for converting {asciidoc}[AsciiDoc] source files and strings into HTML 5, DocBook 5.0, DocBook 4.5 and other formats. 
It's {gem}[published as a RubyGem] and is available under the MIT open source license.

endif::awestruct[]

Asciidoctor uses a set of built-in ERB templates to render the document to HTML 5 or DocBook.
We've matched the rendered output as close as possible to the default output of the native Python processor. 
You can override this behavior by providing {tilt}[Tilt]-compatible templates.
See the <<usage>> section for more details.

== Operating Systems

Asciidoctor works on Linux, Mac and Windows.

== Dependency and Configuration Requirements

Asciidoctor requires one of the following implementations of Ruby:

* Ruby 1.8.7
* Ruby 1.9.3
* Ruby 2.0.0
* JRuby 1.7.4
* Rubinius 1.2.4 or nightly

We expect it will work with other versions of Ruby as well and would welcome help testing them.

// What is considered configuration information?

// What about other sub-projects of Asciidoctor that require Tilt?

////
== List of files/directory structure

Optional depending on the complexity of the project
////

The latest source code is located in the {sources}[Asciidoctor source repository] on GitHub.

== Installation

// Update the test number

NOTE: We're working hard to make Asciidoctor a drop-in replacement for AsciiDoc. 
We're very close, with over 700 tests that ensure compatibility. 
The march is on towards full compliance and beyond.

Asciidoctor can be installed via the +gem+ command, bundler, or the +yum+ package manager.

To install Asciidoctor:

. Open a terminal
. Type the +gem+ command

 $> gem install asciidoctor

To install Asciidoctor using bundler:

. Open your system Gemfile
. Add the +asciidoctor+ gem to your Gemfile using the following text

 source 'https://rubygems.org'
 gem 'asciidoctor'

. Save the Gemfile
. Open a terminal
. Install the gem with bundler

 $> bundle install
 
To install Asciidoctor on Fedora 17 or greater:

. Open a terminal
. Type the +yum+ command
 
 $> sudo yum install rubygem-asciidoctor

The benefit of installing the gem via +yum+ is that the package manager will also install Ruby if it's not already on your machine.

Additional documentation:

* {toolchain}[Installing the Asciidoctor toolchain]
* {install-mac}[Installing Asciidoctor on Mac OS X]

== Upgrade

If you have an earlier version of Asciidoctor installed, you can update it using the +gem+ command:

 $> gem update asciidoctor

[TIP]
====
If you accidentally use +gem install+ instead of +gem update+ then you will have both versions installed.
If you wish to remove the older version use the +gem+ command:

 $> gem cleanup asciidoctor
====

On Fedora, you can update it using:

 $> sudo yum update rubygem-asciidoctor

TIP: Your Fedora system may be configured to automatically update packages, in which case no further action is required by you.
Refer to the http://docs.fedoraproject.org[Fedora docs] if you are unsure.

NOTE: The +yum+ package update will not be available at the same time as the +gem+, it may take several weeks before it becomes available.
If you must have the latest version now, then use the +gem+ method instead.

== Usage

If the +asciidoctor+ gem installed successfully, the +asciidoctor+ command line interface (CLI) will be available on your PATH.
To invoke it, execute:

 $> asciidoctor --version
 Asciidoctor 0.1.4 [http://asciidoctor.org]

In addition to the CLI, Asciidoctor provides an API.
The API is intended for integration with other software projects and is suitable for server-side applications, such as Rails, Sinatra and GitHub.

=== Command line interface (CLI)

Asciidoctor's CLI is a drop-in replacement for the +asciidoc.py+ command from the Python implementation. 
To invoke Asciidoctor from the CLI, execute:

 asciidoctor <asciidoc_file>

This will use the built-in defaults for options and create a new file in the same directory as the input file, with the same base name, but with the +.html+ extension.

There are many other options available and full help is provided via:

 asciidoctor --help

or in the {man}[man page].

There is also an +asciidoctor-safe+ command, which turns on safe mode by default, preventing access to files outside the parent directory of the source file. 
This mode is very similar to the safe mode of +asciidoc.py+.

* {render}[How do I render a document?]
* {factory}[How do I use the Asciidoctor stylesheet factory to produce custom themes?]

=== Ruby API

To use Asciidoctor in your application, you first need to require the gem:

 require 'asciidoctor'

With that in place, you can start processing AsciiDoc documents.

.Loading a document
To parse a file into an +Asciidoctor::Document+ object:

 doc = Asciidoctor.load_file('your_file.asciidoc')

You can get information about the document:

 puts doc.doctitle
 puts doc.attributes

More than likely, you will want to render the document.

.Rendering files
To render a file containing AsciiDoc markup to HTML 5:

 Asciidoctor.render_file('your_file.asciidoc', :in_place => true)

The command will output to the file +your_file.html+ in the same directory. 
You can render the file to DocBook 4.5 by setting the +backend+ attribute to 'docbook':

 Asciidoctor.render_file('your_file.asciidoc', :in_place => true,
   :attributes => {'backend' => 'docbook'})

The command will output to the file +your_file.xml+ in the same directory. 
(If you're on Linux, you can view the file using yelp).

.Rendering strings
To render an AsciiDoc-formatted string:

 puts Asciidoctor.render('*This* is it.')

When rendering a string, the header and footer are excluded by default to make Asciidoctor consistent with other lightweight markup engines like Markdown. 
If you want the header and footer, just enable it using the +:header_footer+ option:

 puts Asciidoctor.render('*This* is it.', :header_footer => true)

Now you'll get a full HTML 5 file. 
As before, you can also produce DocBook 4.5:

 puts Asciidoctor.render('*This* is it.', :header_footer => true,
   :attributes => {'backend' => 'docbook'})

If you don't like the output you see, you can change it. 
Any of it!

.Custom templates
Asciidoctor allows you to override the {templates}[built-in templates] used to render almost any individual AsciiDoc element. 
If you provide a directory of {tilt}[Tilt]-compatible templates, named in such a way that Asciidoctor can figure out which template goes with which element, Asciidoctor will use the templates in this directory instead of its built-in templates for any elements for which it finds a matching template. 
It will fallback to its default templates for everything else.

 puts Asciidoctor.render('*This* is it.', :header_footer => true,
   :template_dir => 'templates')

The Document and Section templates should begin with +document.+ and +section.+, respectively. 
The file extension is used by Tilt to determine which view framework it will use to use to render the template. 
For instance, if you want to write the template in ERB, you'd name these two templates +document.html.erb+ and +section.html.erb+. 
To use Haml, you'd name them +document.html.haml+ and +section.html.haml+.

Templates for block elements, like a Paragraph or Sidebar, would begin with +block_<style>.+. 
For instance, to override the default Paragraph template with an ERB template, put a file named +block_paragraph.html.erb+ in the template directory you pass to the +Document+ constructor using the +:template_dir+ option.

=== Submitting an Issue

We use the {issues}[GitHub issue tracker] associated with this project to track bugs and features. 
Before submitting a bug report or feature request, check to make sure it hasn't already been submitted. 
When submitting a bug report, please include a {gist}[Gist] that includes any details that may help reproduce the bug, including your gem version, Ruby version, and operating system.

Most importantly, since Asciidoctor is a text processor, reproducing most bugs requires that we have some snippet of text on which Asciidoctor exhibits the bad behavior.

An ideal bug report would include a pull request with failing specs.

=== Submitting a Pull Request

. {fork}[Fork the repository].
. {branch}[Create a topic branch].
. Add tests for your unimplemented feature or bug fix.
. Run +bundle exec rake+.
If your tests pass, return to step 3.
. Implement your feature or bug fix.
. Run +bundle exec rake+.
If your tests fail, return to step 5.
. Add documentation for your feature or bug fix.
. If your changes are not 100% documented, go back to step 7.
. Add, commit, and push your changes.
. {pr}[Submit a pull request].

=== Supporting Additional Ruby Versions

If you would like this library to support another Ruby version, you may volunteer to be a maintainer. 
Being a maintainer entails making sure all tests run and pass on that implementation. 
When something breaks on your implementation, you will be personally responsible for providing patches in a timely fashion. 
If critical issues for a particular implementation exist at the time of a major release, support for that Ruby version may be dropped.
